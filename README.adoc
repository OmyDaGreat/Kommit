== ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

=== Configuration File Location

By default, Kommit looks for a `.kommit.yaml` file in the current directory. You can specify a different configuration file using the `--config` option:

[source,sh]
----
kommit --config path/to/config.yaml
----

=== Configuration File Format

The configuration file uses a YAML-inspired format:

[source,yaml]
----
# Comments start with #

# Commit Types

  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - docs: Documentation only changes
  - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
  - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - perf: A code change that improves performance
  - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
  - ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
  - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

# Available Scopes

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Option |Description

|`types`
|List of commit types with their descriptions. Each type follows the format `type: Description`.

|`scopes`
|List of available scopes. You can define scopes for all commit types under the `all` key, or specific scopes for particular commit types.
